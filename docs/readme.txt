Legend of the Mana Sword!

Final Fantasy Adventure, Mystic Quest, Seiken Densetsu--many names, one game. Beloved by many, but also disliked by quite a few. Legend of the Mana Sword's goal is to bring more of the magic from the following games (especially Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 (Trials of Mana) to the seminal game of the the Mana series.

Gameplay and Bug Fixes:
* Using Heal, Unicorn, and the Moogle item no longer corrupts your DP.
* You can now use the Moogle item, Unicorn, or Heal to remove Moogle status effect.
* When using Nectar and Stamina you no longer need to press START or SELECT for them to take effect. (They still won't wear off until a window is shown at least 20 seconds later, so they are still exploitable.)
* Enemies with two possible drops no longer re-randomize if your bags are full.
* Poison is cured on level up, and when riding your chocobo. Stone is cured by chocobo.
* Silence buzzing in certain emulators.
* All known soft locks fixed.
* Poison and Fuji's ASK heal are no longer prevented by attacking.
* Fix the Iron Helmet exploit (because it could unintentionally nerf other equipment).
* Fix the Sickle warp bug.
* Poison now waits one second until it does its first damage. (Fuji's ASK heal still ticks immediately.)
* Puzzles using Snowman and Chests no longer fail randomly.
* Magic Power is set correctly when loading a save.
* Followers now move with player across chain post transits.
* Nuke has been buffed to its original Japanese power.
* New-and-improved Random Number Generator (RNG)!

Graphics:
* New title screen.
* "Shieldless" main character sprites used in a few cutscenes.
* Choice between two main characters.
* Minor tweaks to background graphics throughout, including a new animated tile on the worldmap.
* Many small sprite tweaks.
* Status Bar ("HUD") layout improvements.
* Super Game Boy enhancements, including a border adapted from a piece from the incredible artist orioto celebrating the announcement of the next Mana game, Visions of Mana.
* "Lazy DX" color improvements when played on real hardware or an emulator properly configured with a BIOS.

Script and Text:
* Rewritten intro crawl.
* Hundreds of lines of dialog modified!
* Specifically cleaned up a lot of the dialog most important to the plot.
* Reworked some of the ending because it both didn't make much sense and also ignored the original Japanese script.
* On level up you are given a choice of jobs instead of stats to mirror the Japanese original. (Does not affect gameplay.)
* Excalibur (also Excalbur and XCalibr) renamed Mana Sword.
* Slep spell renamed Sleep.
* Status names are no longer limited to four characters: "Moogle" instead of "Moog", "Poison" instead of "Pois", "Stone" instead of "Ston", and "Blind" instead of "Dark".
* Each spell is now associated with a Mana spirit (Mana spirits were not previously introduced until the second game).
* Original names used for "Shadow Knight", "Bon Voyage", "Granz", "Lorimar", "Genji", and "Mithril".
* Changes to the "Bag of Fang" quest to make it less frustrating and to make the hint actually useful.
* Changes to the Ruins quest so people might be able to do it without searching the web.
* A large number of typos, misspellings, grammar mistakes, awkward phrasings, bad translations, unnecessary verbosity, incorrect pluralization, and unintelligible uninteresting nonsense fixed. (If nonsense is interesting or intelligible it's likely left as is.)
