The main palette for the color target, loaded at startup.

Mimicks the BIOS auto-colorization ("lazy DX") of non-colorized Legend of the Mana Sword.

Background colors are white, green, blue, and black.

Only the first background palette is populated, the rest are monochrome and unused.

Sprite palettes are unused at this point. While they are loaded, all sprites should be dynamically loading their own palettes as they are needed.
