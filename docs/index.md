# Legend of the Mana Sword

Legend of the Mana Sword is a rom hack aimed at being the ultimate version of *Final Fantasy Adventure*, the first game in the Mana series. This revitalized version fixes bugs, polishes graphics, updates the script, and includes numerous quality-of-life improvements.

It also has [enhancements for Super Game Boy](sgb.md) with a custom border, and many "lazy DX" graphics modifications for Game Boy Color (and Game Boy Advance).

Legend of the Mana Sword is a refined experience that enhances this classic while preserving its nostalgic charm. Whether you're curious about where the Mana series started or want to revisit a beloved classic, this is a must-play.
