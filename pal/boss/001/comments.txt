Palettes for Hydra.

Background colors are white, green, blue, and black.

Only the first background palette is populated, the rest are monochrome and unused.

Two boss palettes are loaded--obj5 and obj6.

The boss damage flash effect is is a washed-out version of the colors. Close to but not quite white.

The fireballs and explosion effect--obj4--are currently set the same as obj5.
